# Contributing

In the name of his ghostliness, we thank you for taking an interest in contributing to this project. 

## Issues

As you may have noticed, the Issues page is haunted territory. You are welcome to open new issues, but they will be appropriated by the ghostly forces that inhabit this repository. They usually just rewrite them in their own words, but if they are overwhelmed by the number of issues, they may just close them.

You may also comment or contribute to close any issues created by the ghostly forces.

## Pull Requests

The underworld forces are not yet ready to evaluate code, but they will welcome all pull request and leave a comment on them. 

As with issues, if they are overwhelmed by the number of pull requests, they may just close them. In that case, please re-submit the PR in 24 hours.
